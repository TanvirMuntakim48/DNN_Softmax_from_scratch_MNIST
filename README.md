# MNIST Classification (softmax regression)

In this notebook, I implement a Dense Neural Network with softmax regression from scratch on the MNIST Dataset. I also have added L2 regularization in the code

N.B: The mnist-original.mat can be readily found online and is not included in the repository due to size constraints.
